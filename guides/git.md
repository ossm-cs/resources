## Purpose
git is a *version control system*. It's useful for a few reasons.

Imagine you're developing a program. You realise, 5 hours in, that you've completely messed up. With git, you can revert to previous changes.

git also allows for easy versioning - you don't need to have a million folders:
- Project
- Project (1)
- Project 1.0
- Project Final
- Project Final FINAL
- Project Final FINAL (1)
- Project Release

Now, git allows tagging of releases and tracking of changes. Uploading these changes to GitHub makes collaboration very, very easy.
## Learning git
There are a ton of resources provided by GitHub [here](https://try.github.io). You can also use the official Git tutorial, which is [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).

As with anything in programming, *doing* is the best way to learn.
