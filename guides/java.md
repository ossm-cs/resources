## Information
Java is a programming language.

Before execution, Java code goes through a few stages.

```
.java       | This is the code that you, the programmer, write.
| compiled  | Then, the code is compiled into code that the
v by javac  | JRE can understand.
.class      | This is called *Java bytecode*.
| is read   | Then, the Java virtual machine reads this code.
v by        | This is what allows Java code to run on any machine.
JVM         | Then, the JVM converts byte code into instructions
| translated| that are then executed by the cpu.
v into code | these instructions are then executed.
CPU
```

Java is separated into two components: the *JRE*, or Java Runtime Environment, and the *JDK*, or Java Development Kit.

The JRE is what executes the bytecode, and the JDK is what provides libraries, and compiles your code into the bytecode that the JRE executes.

To run a Java program, the JRE must be installed. To make a Java program, both the JRE and the JDK must be installed.
